    <h1>How to Play Wordle</h1>
    
    <p>Wordle is a word-guessing game where you have to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. Here's how to play:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Start by guessing a five-letter word.</li>
        <li>After each guess, you will receive feedback on your guess:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A green square indicates that a letter is in the correct position.</li>
            <li>A yellow square indicates that a letter is in the word, but in the wrong position.</li>
            <li>A gray square indicates that a letter is not in the word.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Based on the feedback, make your next guess.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.</li>
    </ol>
